                  IT  IS A PROJECT - TO  DETECT AND IDENTIFY HANDWRITTEN DIGITS USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK 
                                        
                                        
                  HOW TO USE:-
                  
                  1 RUN      create_model_1.py
                  2.RUN      create_model_2.py
                  
                  3.Running these files will create files :-
                                      model1.ckpt     and     model2.ckpt       in your project directory
                                      These are models which is used to predict/identify digit 
                                      (It might take some time)
                 4. NOW TO PREDICT  RUN FILES AS  
                                        python predict_1.py    <filename.jpg/png>
                                        python predict_2.py    <filename.jpg/png>
